#Univeristy Social Media
For my undergraduate for the University of Worcester I researched and developed a social media for attending students.
Feature include:
  1. Profile customisation.
  2. Secuity measures.
  3. Private messing between users.
  4. Groups can be created and deleted. Admin privileges can be transfered between users.
  5. Course and module chats.
  6. Search page to find users by name and/or course details.
  7. Responsive front-end to allow different screen sizes to use it. 

##Set up
1. Access the server folder in the cmd -> cd "PATH"\socialmedia\server
2. Run the websocket_server.php file -> php websocket_server.php
3. Incase PHP is not a environment variable -> C:\xampp\php\php.exe websocket_server.php
